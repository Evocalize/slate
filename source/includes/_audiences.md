# Audience Manager API

The Audience Manager is a comprehensive audience management system capable of creating, importing, and managing custom
audiences for use in marketing campaigns. Evocalize currently supports the creation and management of Meta audiences.

Audience Placeholders are used to associate channel-agnostic audience properties, such as customer data, with multiple
audiences spanning multiple channels. Audience Placeholders can be associated with Evocalize-created or partner-provided
audiences. Blueprints that support audience targeting are preconfigured to select the best audience per channel from the
Audience Placeholder's associated audiences.

Contact your Client Success representative for more information regarding the Audience Manager.

### Evocalize-Created Audiences

Audience Placeholders can be associated with audiences created by Evocalize using customer data collected and provided
by your organization. Evocalize configures a set of rules for your organization for determining the type of audience(s)
to create per channel, the account to create the audience under, and the account(s) to share the audience with.

The creation process for an Audience Placeholder and associated audiences is:

1. Create an Audience Placeholder using the `Create Audience Placeholder API`. A successful response should include the
   newly created Audience Placeholder with a `pending` status. No audiences are associated with it.
2. Upload your customer data using the `Upload Audience CSV Data API`. Upon completion of uploading your customer data,
   Evocalize will automatically begin creating audiences on behalf of your organization. A successful response should
   include the Audience Placeholder updated to a `processing` status.
3. Audience creation can take up to 24 hours to complete. Channel-specific audiences created by this process will be
   associated with the Audience Placeholder. Once audience creation is complete, the Audience Placeholder will be
   updated to a `completed` status. Moreover, Audience Placeholder and associated audiences can be used in blueprints
   supporting audience targeting. You can check the status of the Audience Placeholder and associated audiences using
   the `Get Audience Placeholder By ID API`.

### Partner-Provided Audiences

Audience Placeholders can be associated with active, existing channel-specific audiences provided by your organization.
See `Add Existing Channel Audience API` for more information. Audience Placeholders that are created from a
partner-provided audience can immediately be used in blueprints supporting audience targeting.

## Create Audience Placeholder

> Create Audience Placeholder Request Example

```json
{
  "name": "Audience Placeholder Name",
  "description": "Audience Placeholder Description",
  "grants": [
    {
      "grantee": {

section for more details.

**Response Codes**:

- `200 OK` - Returning the newly created Audience Placeholder details including the ID.
- `400 BAD REQUEST` - When the request is malformed, or you attempt to associate to a non-existent user or group.

## Upload Audience Data CSV

After Evocalize creates audiences on behalf of your organization, these audiences will need to be assigned users using
customer data collected by your organization. This customer data can be provided to Evocalize in the form of a CSV and
uploaded via this endpoint.

Requirements:

1. The CSV must contain a header row which is the first row containing the data identifier name of each column.
2. Every data identifier in the CSV must be hashed as SHA-256 and comply with the requirements listed in the table
   below. Moreover, there must be at least one data identifier present in your CSV.
3. In the case of incomplete data for a specific data identifier, omit the header and column data for that data
   identifier. For example, if you only have a list of email addresses then include only the email address header and
   column data in your CSV.
4. The CSV must have at least 300 data identifiers to ensure a minimum of 100 matches.
5. Although any data identifiers can be present in your CSV, we encourage including a minimum of email or phone. Emails
   can drive stronger match rates compared to other supported data identifiers.
