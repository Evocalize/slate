# Media Library API

The Evocalize CMP Media Library allows for the storage and permissions of various media assets. Media assets are
references to media files that are suitable for being used in an advertising creative in at least one of the marking
channels supported by the Evocalize platform. Currently, we support image and video assets.

This API can be used to import partner-owned advertising media into their Media Library.

## Create Or Update Media

> Create Or Update Request Example

```json
{
  "id": "1234",
  "name": "Image Name",
  "type": "image",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/image.png",
  "userId": "test_user_id" // only present on create
}

```

> Create Or Update Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1234",
    "name": "Image Name",
    "type": "image",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/image.png",
    "userId": "test_user_id" // only present on create
  }
}
```

This endpoint allows you to create or update media within your organization.

On create, this API allows assigning user ownership to a media. Users owning the media will be able to see it in their
Media Library via the CMP and create/edit ad campaigns with it. Media cannot change user ownership once it is created.

On update, the URL and name can change but not the media type.
